# Python Internship Project – Productivity Suite

## Project Description
This project is a **Python-based Productivity Suite** developed as part of an internship program.  
It is a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** application that combines multiple useful tools into a single program to improve productivity and practice core Python concepts.

The project demonstrates strong fundamentals in **Python programming, file handling, logic building, and modular coding**.



## Features
- Calculator (basic arithmetic operations)
- Notes Manager (create, view, and manage notes)
- Timer & Stopwatch
- File Organizer
- Menu-driven CLI interface
- File handling for data storage



## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- File Handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Standard Python Libraries
