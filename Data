 Data Used in This Project

Your project uses local filesystem data, stored inside the data/ directory.
There is no online data, API data, or database data — everything is stored as simple files.

The data can be categorized into two types:

 Notes Data (used by Notes Manager)
 Location:
data/notes/

 What is stored here?

Each note the user creates is stored as a text file or JSON file, such as:

note_20250110_153200.txt
note_20250214_meeting.txt

Contents of each note file:

Title

Timestamp

Note content

Optional metadata (tags, edited time, etc.)

Example file content:

Title: Shopping List
Date: 2025-02-14
---------------------
- Milk
- Eggs
- Bread

Purpose:

 Persistent storage
 Allows reading, editing, deleting
 Easy to back up

 Backup Data (used by File Organizer / Notes Manager)
 Location:
data/backups/

 What is stored here?

Backups of user notes

Backups of folders before organizing

ZIP files or simple folders containing backup copies

Example backup files:

notes_backup_20250214.zip
backup_20250201_180000/

Purpose:

 Safety before file organization
 Restore notes if needed
 Version history (optional)
